## My process

I began by writing the HTML. Afterwards, I styled the card using CSS and Flexbox. I used a desktop first approach then I worked on the tablet and mobile version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS variables and how to use Flexbox and media queries to achieve responsive design.

### Continued development

I feel like I could have written less CSS than I did. For instance, I feel there could have been a shorter and more efficient way to style the card's border radius. I'll work on the following areas:

- Writing CSS shorthand to write less CSS.
- Using media queries: I spent a lot of time trying to make the card responsive and it wasn't responsive on some screens. I opted for a column layout for devices 768px and below. However, I feel there's a better solution.
- Writing CSS classes: I had to go back to the index.html file a couple of times because I had omitted classes.
- Margins and paddings: I was fairly pleased with the final result, especially on desktop but I spent a lot of time adjusting the margins and paddings.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31217268/center-div-on-the-middle-of-screen) - I wasn't quite sure how to center the card. This resource proved useful.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - I wasn't quite sure how to make the card responsive on mobile. This article helped me write the media queries to make the card responsive.
- [Resource 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30162103/change-flex-direction-on-wrap) - This page also helped me make the card responsive using Flexbox.
